This example tests approximation of data with known error (standard deviation).
It reconstructs superposition of two known functions in square [0,1]^2.

In the first case, the data consists of 100, 300 or 1000 random points of
Franke test function with standard deviation of 0.2 and equal number of random
points of linear function z = x + y with standard deviation of 5.

In the second case, the data consists of 100, 300 or 1000 random points of
linear function z = x + y with standard deviation of 0.2 and equal number of random points of Franke test function with standard deviation of 5.

To generate and approximate the data, run "./test.sh" or "make".
To visualize, in Matlab run "viewexample".
To clean up the directory, run "make clean".

Good luck!

This is a stripped version of "experimental implementation of complex variables
in gcc (the GNU C language compiler) corresponding to the proposed C9X new C
language specification" available from

http://www.netlib.org/cephes/c9x-complex.tgz

It is sufficient for compiling `gridgen' on platforms with gcc if the version
used lacks c99 support.

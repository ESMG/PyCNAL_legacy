This directory contains a number of examples for generating grids with gridgen.

example 0:
	An estuary with two elongated channels.
example 1: 
	An estuary with one channel.
example 2: 
	Same as example 1 except the turning points placed at different 
	locations. This produces a different result for the same boundary;
	demonstrates how to implictely control the cell density by changing 
	locations of the turning points.
example 3: 
	A shape from the CRDT paper.
example 4: 
	Use of non-right angles.
example 5: 
	Just for the sake of it.
example 6: 
	Same as example 5, with custom cell density.

To build example grids,

   1. Make `gridgen' in the upper level directory
   2. Run:
      make

To visualize grids, in Matlab run:

   viewall

or, for a particular grid, use scripts viewgrid() and vg(), e.g.:

   viewgrid('prm.0','v');
   vg('grid.0');

Good luck!

This example is run on elevation data obtained from digitised contours. 
(Thanks to Maciej Sieczka, Institute of Plant Biology, Wroclaw University.)
It is characterised by strong clustering of data points and big gaps between 
clusters.

To reproduce the example, run "./test.sh" or "make".
To visualize, in Matlab run "viewexample" (which takes time to plot) or 
"viewinterp('data.txt', 'nn.txt');".
To clean up, run "make clean".

Good luck!

This real-life example is run on a topographic data from satellite altimeter. 
(Thanks to Prof. David A. Paige, Dept. of Earth and Space Sciences, UCLA.)
Similar to example 3, the data points belong to nodes of a rectangular grid,
but also there is a large gap between two main clusters of data.

To reproduce the example, run "./test.sh" or "make".
To visualize, in Matlab run "viewexample" or 
"viewinterp('data.txt', 'nn-0.txt');".
To clean up, run "make clean".

Good luck!

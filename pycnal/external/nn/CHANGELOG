v. 1.82, 12 May 2010
        -- Modified "configure" to check whether compiler option 
           "-fno-force-mem" is supported.
v. 1.81, 29 May 2009
        -- Added flag NN_SERIAL to the default compiler options for building 
           nnbathy.
v. 1.80, 12 December 2008
        -- Changed the license for compatibility with GPL. Added the file
           LICENSE.
v. 1.79, 24 September 2008
        -- Fixed some minor deficiencies in `minell' - thanks to Glen Low for
           the bug report and extensive testing. This fix does not affect
           performance of `nn'.
v. 1.78, 18 January 2008
	-- Modified Matlab code in the examples to take care of what seems to
           be a new behaviour of RANGE function.
v. 1.77, 19 November 2007
        -- Reduced writing the % of the job completed to stderr to the instances
           when the reported value has actually changed (with the precision of
           0.1%).
v. 1.76, 16 November 2007
        -- Fixed a defect in nnpi_calculate_weights() that caused double 
           deallocation in some rare cases (a degenerate point on the convex 
           hall). Thanks for Maciek Sieczka for reporting this bug.
v. 1.75, 30 October 2007
        -- Modified delaunay_circles_find() and nnpi_reset(). Got rid of the
           non-scalable stuff that slowed down processing of big datasets.
           Many thanks to John Gerschwitz, Petroleum Geo-Services, for finding 
           this defect.
v. 1.74, 30 October 2007
        -- Modified treatment of degenerate cases in nnpi_triangle_process(),
           many thanks to John Gerschwitz, Petroleum Geo-Services, for exposing
           the defect introduced in v. 1.69. Changed EPS_SAME from 1.0e-15 to
           1.0e-8. A number of cosmetic changes.
v. 1.73, 5 July 2007
        -- Removed functional code from within assert()s, which caused problems
           for production builds on Visual Studio. Thanks to Alok Saldanha for 
           reporting this defect.
v. 1.72, 4 July 2007
        -- Moved division by "denom" in circle_build2() and circle_build1() to
           after the check on denom == 0; otherwise division on 0 raised 
           exception on some systems. Thanks to Alok Saldanha for reporting this
           bug.
v. 1.71, 17 January 2007
	-- Made the test on whether an output point exactly coincides with
           an input point in nnpi_triangle_process() approximate.
v. 1.70, 24 November 2006
        -- Added example 6.
v. 1.69, 22 November 2006
	-- Substantial changes in processing of the degenerate case for Sibson
           interpolation. This is the case when an interpolation point is close
           to being in between data points. It is no longer handled by a pair
           of symmetric displacements of this point; instead, the center of the
           corresponding circumcircle is moved elsewhere in a specific way.
v. 1.68, 28 September 2006
        -- Edited README
v. 1.67, 30 August 2006
        -- Introduced -% option (available only when built with -DNN_SERIAL)
v. 1.66, 26 June 2006
	-- Introduced this file
	-- Fixed error in reading the command-line input after "-L"
        -- Made a few cosmetic changes

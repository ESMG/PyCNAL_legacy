nn
Natural Neighbours interpolation library
Version 1.82

Provides Natural Neighbours interpolation library "libnn.a" and a command line
Natural Neighbours interpolation utility "nnbathy".

`nn' is a free software. See LICENSE for details.

(Note that however that `triangle' is not a free softwre.)

Please send comments and bugs to Pavel.Sakov<at>gmail.com .


1. This code has been developed and used mainly on pc-linux platform, however,
it should compile on other platforms. Beware that the configure script 
currently does not do much more than a couple of checks. It should be viewed 
rather as a prototype for the future than a multi-platform configuration tool.

`nn' was initially based on the Dave Watson's `nngridr'. Over time, there were
numerous improvements of this original version. You may see comparison of 
performance of a rather old version `nn' with `nngridr' in

  Quanfu Fan, Alon Efrat, Vladlen Koltun, Shankar Krishnan, and 
  Suresh Venkatasubramanian. Hardware-assisted Natural Neighbor Interpolation. 
  In Proc. 7th Workshop on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX), 2005.

Note that the current version of `nn' outperforms the version tested in the
above paper both in terms of scalability and robustness.


2. To compile, run:

configure
make
(make install)

For a few quick tests, run:

make tests
./nnphi_test
./nnai_test
./ht_test


3. Apart from the `nn' library, this code contains `nnbathy' -- a simple 
interpolation utility/example based on `nn'.

Initially, `nnbathy' has been introduced to provide an example of using library
functions from `nn'. Later, evolving along with user requests, it became a quite
functional command-line utility.


4. There are a number of examples of using `nnbathy' in "examples" directory:

examples/1 -- reconstruction of Franke test function
examples/2 -- reconstruction of bathymetry from sonar data
examples/3 -- performance on degenerate data
examples/4 -- reconstruction of topography from satellite altimeter data
examples/5 -- reconstruction of topography from digitised contours
examples/6 -- reconstruction of topography from digitised contours

These examples has been put up over a a number of years. Some of them used to
cause failures for the older versions of the code. See examples/README for 
descriptions.


5. Calling `nn' code from a client code is supposed to be straightforward and 
simple. Have a look at nnbathy.c for an example. For a basic description of 
structures and functions available from `nn', have a look at "nn.h".


6. Acknowledgments:

This library uses the following public code/algorithms:
  1. `triangle' by Jonathan Richard Shewchuk -- for Delaunay triangulation;
  2. Dave Watson's algorithm for Sibson interpolation;
  3. Belikov and Semenov's formulas for non-Sibsonian interpolation.

Many thanks to David A. Paige, Maciek Sieczka, Nick Cahill and John Gerschwitz 
for submitting bug reports and/or data for examples.


7. Please acknowledge the use of this software in publications.

Good luck!

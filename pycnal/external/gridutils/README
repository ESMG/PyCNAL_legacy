Grid Utilities
Version 0.47

Priovides C library functions and utilities for handling 2D grids. Developed
and used for grids generated by `gridgen', but can be used to handle arbitrary
2D quadrilateral grids.

This code has is being developed and used under i386/Linux. I do not think
there will be major problems for porting it elsewhere. Please let me know if
you managed to do it.

Beware that the configure script currently does not do much more than a couple
of checks. It should be viewed rather as a prototype for the future than a
multi-platform configuration tool.

To compile, run:

configure
make
(make install)

Please acknowledge use of this software in publications.

Good luck!

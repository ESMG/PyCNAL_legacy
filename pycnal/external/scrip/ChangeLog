Version: scrip1.4_pop-roms_01
One-line summary:  Modifications to correctly remap between ROMS and POP grids

Changes made:

* added two arrays to grids.f, grid1_periodic and grid2_periodic, to help track
  the periodicity of the grids.  SCRIP had previously assumed, at least in the
  bilinear remapping, that the grids were both periodic and it created trouble
  for regridding ROMS and POP grids, since the ROMS grid is regional
* added grid1_periodic and grid2_periodic to the namelist read in by SCRIP.
  The defaults for these arrays are set to TRUE, so that it does not impact
  the typical use of SCRIP.
* added an optional argument "check_mask" to the routine grid_search_nbr in
  remap_distwgt.  The use of this argument is intended to force the search
  routine to return the nearest unmasked neighbors instead of simply returning
  the nearest neighbors.
* heavily modified the routine remap_bilin to handle the situation where a 
  returned square of source grid points contains the search point but some of
  the points in that square are masked.  Previously, SCRIP would simply blow
  off that found point and create no links - or regrid weights - associated
  with it.  The modifications add logic to:
  - for the case where some, but not all, of the points in the square are masked
    the masked points are discarded and the weights associated with the unmasked
    points are renormalized
  - for the case where all of the points in the square are masked, the code now
    does a nearest neighbor search using grid_search_nbr requesting the routine
    only return unmasked neighbors, as described above
* the routine remap_bilin is also changed to not use a distance-weighted average
  after a failed search.  That logic was included in SCRIP to handle a situation
  near the poles, but the unaligned grids cause many failed searches that really
  should not succeed.
